     Thanks for visiting my website. I've built this website for a school project and I am happy with how it turned out. I've put a lot of time in this website and want to explain some things about it. First, why is this website in English, because it looks cool. The second page (shop) has been coded with javascript and it turn out perfect. Unfortunalty you cannot order anything here. All the pages have been made with a video background. I first made the whole website and then put the content in it because I had no idea what to make the website about. I came to the idea after a student who looked after the class while the teacher was teaching from home said to me that the website looked like The North Face website, and so my idea and inspiration. Another student asked me to go to work because she thought I was ordering a new jacket, I think that's funny and I see it as a compliment. This is my best html project so far and I hope the make many more in the future. I hope you enjoyed looking at my work and I hope I get a good grade. <br><br>~Joris
